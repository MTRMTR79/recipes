        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is an amazing recipe I have now used many times to get a luscious caramel flavor with the slight burnt flavor, yet still delicious.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups cream</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>7 egg yolks</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot over medium heat, melt ¾ cup sugar with 3 tablespoons water, swirling skillet frequently, until sugar turns to a liquid and all the water is boiled away.</li>
            <li>Slowly add heavy cream and milk while stirring quickly to mix in the caramel and keep the temp high. Once smooth, add remaining ¼ cup sugar and the salt. Once everything is dissolved, remove from heat.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream.</li>
            <li>Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer’s instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.</li>
        </ol>
