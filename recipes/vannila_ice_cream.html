        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>People always think Vannila is the plain flavor, for when there isn't really a flavor. Ohhh boy are they wrong. This recipe proves that. 
            This is an amazing recipe I have now used many times to get delecate Vannila flavor.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup cream</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 vannila bean</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>7 egg yolks</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot over medium heat, add sugar, cream, milk, salt, and the almighty vannila bean. Heat until sugar is disolved, and it is <strong>almost</strong> to a boil, but not quite. Turn off heat and let it steep for 30 minutes to an hour (or longer if you want more flavour).</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream.</li>
            <li>Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, . Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer’s instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.</li>
        </ol>
