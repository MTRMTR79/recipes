# recipes
Hello! This is Thilo from 28/3/23 I am very excited about this whole Odin Project thing, and so am going to make this recipe website, for now this will be pure html, and then when I learn it I will add CSS, and maybe even javascript eventually, This should act as a test ground, to pracice skills. I will continue to update as I progress.
